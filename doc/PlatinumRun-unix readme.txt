This script is for a wallet "Platinum". To enable, POS-mining open /.PLATINUM/Platinum.conf

 and add line "staking=1" after that, complite script PlatinumRun-unix.sh as a root user. If you

haven't root, open shell and type "sudo passwd root", and set any password (DON'T FORGET THAT PASS).

That script make your daemon Platinumd autorun anytime after boot your system.
